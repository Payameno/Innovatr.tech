          Hello!
          My name is Jeff Bridges and I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer. I pivoted from being a Certified HVAC/R Technician due to always having an interest in problem solving and bringing ideas to life. With Web Development, I can nurture my creativity through a new medium and I'm excited to build intuitive, responsive, and efficient web applications. I graduated from Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp in August 2022 and am looking to build upon the experiences I gained there. Currently I'm learning C# and refining the skills already learned so that I can begin work on my next project!

          I'd love to hear from you. Whether it's a job opportunity, a project collaboration, or just to chat. Please feel free to contact me.
